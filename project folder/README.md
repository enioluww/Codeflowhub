# a few things to note about running my app on docker


- when you docker compose up the first time i realized that sometimes the sever doesnt connect to mysql immediately, so you might have to stop it by using the command (CTRL C ) and running docker compuser up again
- also try to login a second time if you get kicked out for not beign logged in correctly
- also sometimes when you add things like questions or replies it might be slow to show up ( you can just try refreshing the page again)
