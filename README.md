# Codeflowhub

## Website for Codeflowhub

Codeflowhub is a community-driven platform designed specifically for developers—think **Reddit, but for coders**.

It allows users to create and join channels focused on different programming languages, frameworks, tools, or topics. Within these channels, users can post messages, ask questions, share insights, and discuss technical problems in a collaborative environment.

Key features include:
- **User accounts and authentication**
- **Topic-based channels** for organized discussions
- **Threaded messages and discussions**
- **Upvote and downvote system** to surface high-quality content
- **Session-based interactions** for a smooth user experience

The goal of Codeflowhub is to provide a focused, developer-first space where programmers can learn from each other, share knowledge, and collaborate—without the noise of general-purpose social platforms.


## Project Description

I've developed a web application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

- The **backend**, powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, communicates with a **MySQL** database, storing and retrieving data related to:
  - Users  
  - Channels  
  - Messages  
  - Upvotes  
  - Downvotes  

- Integrated middleware packages include:
  - CORS  
  - cookie-parser  
  - express-session  
  - body-parser  
  - bcrypt  
  - multer  

  These enhance functionality and security.

- The **frontend** is built with **React.js** for a dynamic and modular user interface, utilizing hooks such as:
  - `useState`
  - `useEffect`

- **Axios** is used for HTTP requests, and **session storage** is leveraged for efficient data handling.

- **Docker Compose** ensures a consistent environment across development, testing, and production stages.
