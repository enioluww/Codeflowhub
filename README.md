Project Description:

I've developed a web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, communicates with a MySQL database, storing and retrieving data related to users, channels, messages, upvotes, and downvotes. I've integrated various middleware packages such as CORS, cookie-parser, express-session, body-parser, bcrypt, and multer for enhanced functionality and security. On the frontend, I've utilized React.js for a dynamic and modular user interface, employing hooks like useState and useEffect. Additionally, I've used axios for making HTTP requests and session storage for efficient data handling. Docker Compose ensures a consistent environment across development, testing, and production stages.

Instructions to Run the Project:

Database Setup:

Ensure MySQL is installed.
Set up a MySQL database and create tables for users, channels, messages, upvotes, and downvotes.
Backend Setup:

Navigate to the backend directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Set up environment variables for database connection, session secret, etc.
Run the backend server with npm start.
Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Update API endpoint URLs if needed.
Start the React app with npm start.
Docker Setup (Optional):

If Docker is preferred, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
Build and run the Docker containers using docker-compose up.
Access the Application:

Open my web browser and navigate to the specified URL where the frontend is hosted, typically at http://localhost:3000.
